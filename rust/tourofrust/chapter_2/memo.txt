Basic Control Flow

---

no parentheses

if x < 42 {
    println!("less than 42");
}

---

loop {
    if x == 42 {
        break
    }
}

---

while x != 42{
}

---

for x in 0..5 {}
for x in 0..=5 {}

---

match x {
    0 => {}
    _ => {}
}

---

let x = loop {
    break "loop value";
}

---

block expression

let v = if x < 42 { -1 } else { 1 };
let v = { let a = 1; a }
fn example() -> int32 { 3 }
let result = match food { _ => "hotdog" }
