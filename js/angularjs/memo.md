## overview

- components
  - model
  - view
  - whatever
    - controller

- two roles of controller
  - data biding
    - model -> view
  - event handling
    - view -> model

- description of components

```nolang
Template	HTML with additional markup
Directives	extend HTML with custom attributes and elements
Model	the data shown to the user in the view and with which the user interacts
Scope	context where the model is stored so that controllers, directives and expressions can access it
Expressions	access variables and functions from the scope
Compiler	parses the template and instantiates directives and expressions
Filter	formats the value of an expression for display to the user
View	what the user sees (the DOM)
Data Binding	sync data between the model and the view
Controller	the business logic behind views
Dependency Injection	Creates and wires objects and functions
Injector	dependency injection container
Module	a container for the different parts of an app including controllers, services, filters, directives which configures the Injector
Service	reusable business logic independent of views
```

- user (DOM, view)
  - generated by compiling template

- controller interacts with them (two-way data biding)
  - updates in view
  - updates in model

- directives

  - two parts of expression and filter
    - evaluated in a scope

    ```ng
    {{ expression | filter }}
    ```

  - examples
    - ng-app
    - ng-controller
    - ng-init
    - ng-model
    - ng-repeat
    - ng-click

- service
  - it comes to be used when the application grows
  - move view-independent logic from the controller into a service
  - to be reused by other parts of the application

- examples
  - html: template is superset of html, which includes additional markup
  - ng-agp, ng-init, ng-model: html attribute, directive of angularjs
  - directive: ng-app

```html
<div ng-app ng-init="qty=1;cost=2">
  <b>Invoice:</b>
  <div>
    Quantity: <input type="number" min="0" ng-model="qty">
  </div>
  <div>
    Costs: <input type="number" min="0" ng-model="cost">
  </div>
  <div>
    <b>Total:</b> {{qty * cost | currency}}
  </div>
</div>
```
