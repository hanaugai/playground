- distribution
  - source distribution: a distribution format (using python setup.py sdist) that provides metadata and the essential source files needed for installing by a tool like pip, or for generating a Built Distribution.

  - built distribution: a distribution format containing files and metadata that only need to be moved to the correct location on the target system, to be installed. Wheel is such a format, whereas distutilâ€™s Source Distribution is not, in that it requires a build step before it can be installed. This format does not imply that Python files have to be precompiled (Wheel intentionally does not include compiled Python files).

    - binary distribution: one kind
    - egg: one of format by setuptools

- module
  - pure module: a module written by python like *.py
  - extension module: a module written in the low-level language
    - a single dynamically loadable pre-compiled file like *.so (shared object)

- package
  - distribution package
  - import package

  - system package

- package vs module
- pip vs setup.py
